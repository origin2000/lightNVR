/**
 * Unified Detection Recording Thread
 * 
 * This module implements a unified thread that handles:
 * - Continuous RTSP packet reading from go2rtc
 * - Circular buffer for pre-detection content
 * - Object detection on keyframes
 * - MP4 recording with proper pre/post buffer support
 * 
 * The key innovation is that a single thread manages the entire pipeline,
 * ensuring that pre-buffer content is always available when detection triggers.
