# LightNVR API Documentation

This document describes the REST API endpoints provided by LightNVR.

## API Overview

LightNVR provides a RESTful API that allows you to interact with the system programmatically. The API is accessible via HTTP and returns JSON responses using the cJSON library. The API is served by the libuv + llhttp web server.

## Authentication

If authentication is enabled in the configuration file, API requests must include a valid session token. Obtain a session by calling the login endpoint, then include the session cookie in subsequent requests.

```bash
# Login to get a session
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"yourpassword"}' \
  http://your-lightnvr-ip:8080/api/auth/login

# Use session cookie for subsequent requests
curl -b cookies.txt http://your-lightnvr-ip:8080/api/streams
```
